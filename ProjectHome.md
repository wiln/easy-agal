EasyAGAL is an open source ActionScript library that assists developers in writing AGAL ("Adobe Graphics Assembly Language") by providing an AS3-based pseudo-AGAL command set.  The resulting advantages include:

  * Code completion and hinting
  * More easy-to-read code
  * Macros organized into libraries
  * Dynamic code customization

EasyAGAL provides training wheels to learning AGAL.  All methods of EasyAGAL maintain the same parameters, in the same order, as AGAL opcodes;  They are all documented with ASDoc tags providing help for every instruction and register as you type, including the original AGAL opcodes.
